your metric/score. Mathematically, it is represented as follows:


Weighted Rating (WR) = (v/v+m.R)+(m/v+m.C)



step -0- .quantile() for calculate percentile 


step -1- Define a TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)  Vectorizer Object. Remove all english stop words such as 'the', 'a'

step -2- Compute the cosine similarity matrix






your metric/score. Mathematically, it is represented as follows:

Weighted Rating (WR) = (vv+m.R)+(mv+m.C)
